With the development of blockchain technology, the huge economic benefits that come with it are becoming increasingly prominent. Blockchain technology is getting closer and closer to our lives. The recent currency market storm must be known to those who know about blockchain. We all know that there are two major camps in blockchain technology at present, the currency circle and the chain circle. The currency circle mainly extends a series of companies and products based on public chain technology and wallet technology, while the chain circle mainly uses alliance chain technology. The content of our book mainly belongs to the technology of the currency circle. The book will involve some public chain technologies, but the main content of the book is still blockchain wallet technology.


This book is about one of the most popular technologies, blockchain wallet technology. We will start with the basics and go deep into the core of wallet technology. The last chapter will teach two practical blockchain wallet technologies that I led to develop. Although I will start with the most basic content when writing this book, I will not explain too much about programming languages. I hope that readers of this book can learn about the programming languages, network protocols, and encryption algorithms involved in this book in advance. This book is aimed at blockchain wallet developers and people who are interested in blockchain wallet technology.


Before reading this book, you may need to have some knowledge of the following technologies and programming languages:

* Public chain technology (especially the account system currently supported by the public chain, of course, this part of the content will be introduced in detail in this book)
* Encryption algorithm
* Golang (one of the most widely used programming languages ​​in blockchain technology)
* Java (carrying the business logic of the wallet)
* Nodejs (wallet local account, transaction signature)
* electron (front-end desktop framework, will be used in project practice)
* Vue (front-end framework, will be used in project practice)
* Nginx
* Database technology
* Network communication technology
* Peer-to-peer network communication
* IOS and Android

The technologies involved are far more than the above ones. The above are just the more important technologies used in wallet technology.

The reason why the author wrote this book is to enable the majority of blockchain enthusiasts to better learn blockchain wallet technology. At present, there are very few articles on the Internet that explain blockchain wallets, and the quality is also uneven. This affects the understanding and learning of the majority of blockchain enthusiasts. There are not many people who master blockchain wallet technology now, and there is no book on the market that thoroughly introduces blockchain wallet technology. Of course, the author may not be able to introduce this technology thoroughly. The author's level is limited. If there are any errors in this book, everyone is welcome to communicate and correct them.
